      helping the community through fundraisers, the Miss Kona
      Coffee pageant, and IT work, which lead him to his
      involvement in computers. At the age of twelve he learned his
      first computer language, Java, which allowed him to work on
      plugin development for various video game services. Through
      Java, Zion discovered his first love for computer security as
      he discovered the basics of packet analysis,
      allowing him to start his daring decent into the world of
      security.</span></p>

      alterations, and mass event injecting into cloud connected
      laptops. Though most of his exploits were not rigorously
      discovered, he found joy in understanding the inner workings
      of computers. Through is discoveries in computer security, he
      was recommend into a work-study program with the National
      Security Agency (NSA), where he received a position at the
