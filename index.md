## About Me
<hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">

I'm a a PhD student at Arizona State University studying Computer Science with a focus in Systems Security; you may know me online as [mahaloz](https://github.com/mahaloz). I was born and raised on the [Big Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii_(island)), and I'm proudly [Native Hawaiian](https://www.nps.gov/locations/hawaii/heritage.htm). When I'm not doing research I like to play in ethical hacking competitions called [CTFs](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) with the internationally known team [Shellphish](http://shellphish.net/) as one of the co-captains. I also run the [ASU Hacking Club](https://asuhacking.club), which is the pipeline to Shellphish. 

I research with the computer security lab [SEFCOM](http://sefcom.asu.edu/) at ASU under [Dr. Fish Wang](https://ruoyuwang.me) and [Dr. Yan Shoshitaishvili](https://www.yancomm.net/). I'm interested in most things binary analysis, but I especially like: decompilation, the reverse engineering process, and CFG recovery. I also like working on educational outreach material, like the education platform [pwn.college](https://pwn.college), as well as open-source security tools which can be found on my GitHub.
