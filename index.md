## About
<hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">

I'm a Ph.D. student at Arizona State University studying Computer Science with a focus on Systems Security. 
Online, I go by the handle [mahaloz](https://github.com/mahaloz). 
I was born and raised on the [Big Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii_(island)), and I'm proudly [Native Hawaiian](https://www.nps.gov/locations/hawaii/heritage.htm).

I **research** with the security lab [SEFCOM](http://sefcom.asu.edu/) at ASU under [Dr. Fish Wang](https://ruoyuwang.me) and [Dr. Yan Shoshitaishvili](https://www.yancomm.net/).
My research interests are in program analysis, with an emphasis on binary analysis, reverse engineering, and decompilation. 
A full listing of my publications can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RKZkfRQAAAAJ&hl=en).
Research prototypes and tools from these works can be found on [my GitHub](https://github.com/mahaloz), including our decompiler [angr decompiler](https://github.com/angr/angr-management).

I **hack** with the epic team [Shellphish](http://shellphish.net/), of which I was a previous co-captain. 
We play in hacking competitions called [CTFs](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/), organize competitions, and develop new tools for the community. 
Using my experience on the team, I've created a variety **educational** materials found in [pwn.college](https://pwn.college), ['Ike](https://ike.mahaloz.re), and lectures presented for the [ASU Hacking Club](https://asuhacking.club). 

If you're looking for technical-oriented content, like CVE announcements, writeups, and research musings, then take a look at my technical blog [mahaloz.re](https://mahaloz.re).
I also make post announcements on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mahal0z).
